## Anacondas on an Aircraft

A man just witnessed a vicious murder of an FBI agent by a big time gangster. Manuel El
Jackson, an FBI agent, is in charge of making sure that he makes it to the trial. They are traveling
to the trial on the plane when the gangster releases a cage of venomous snakes that attack the
passengers. Manuel El Jackson has to keep everyone safe on the aircraft from these anacondas.
He is well equipped with weapons to fight the snakes. If he can keep the witness safe and make it
to the trial, Manuel El Jackson will help remove a serious criminal from the streets. The setting is
on a plane that is flying to the trial. The game is a shooter type game where your main priority is
to keep Manuel El Jackson alive so that he can continue to fight off all the snakes.


The playerâ€™s main objective is to kill a never ending amount of snakes on a never ending plane
ride while trying to stay alive. The main challenge to overcome is to defeat the snakes so that
they cannot get to the Manuel or the rest of the passengers and hurt them. The trial is very
important. Other challenges are killing the snakes with the different weapons that Manuel can
use. The player can collect different weapons and get health power ups. The overall goal is to get
the high score. The game never ends. The snakes just appear at a faster rate that the player will
no longer be able to defeat.


The user has basic up, down, left, and right controls of Manuel so that he can avoid the snakes,
collect power ups and fire his guns at the snakes. As the game continues and more snakes are in
the plane, the player must be quick and accurate to kill the snakes and protect the witness. The
user also will use space bar to fire the flame thrower or shotgun.


There are many dynamics to the game. When the snakes get shot or hit by a flame or grenade,
they turn into a blood spot on the floor of the plane and then disappear. When Manuel gets bit or
is too close to a snake, he will lose health. When Manuel has no health left, the game ends. As
the player shoots the gun or other weapon, the amount of ammo decreases until it cannot be used
anymore. Also the player and the snakes have to move around. This can slow up the snakes as
they chase Manuel around the plane.


The game will be more than just a reaction based game although being fast to react will be very
beneficial. There can be multiple strategies. One strategy could be to run away from the snakes
and make them all congregate in one spot so that more can be killed with one shot. Another
strategy could be to kill the snakes as soon as they appear. This would make the plane have
fewer snakes in the field of play.


With the flame thrower power up, Manuel can light the seats of the airplane on fire. When the
snakes run into the chairs, they catch on fire and die. The seats only stay lit for about five
seconds and the seats can be lit on fire many times. This creates a strategy of lighting the chairs
on fire and leading the snakes into the seats to kill them. Health power ups and different weapons
will make the game last longer and be an interesting part to the game.
