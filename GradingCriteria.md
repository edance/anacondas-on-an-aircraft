# Grading Criteria

### Is the game well designed and fun to play?

The gameplay is very fast. The anacondas start attacking very quickly and it is a tough to keep
up. As the player continues to play the game, the snakes start to appear at a much faster rate.
The player must be smart to conserve the flame thrower fuel because the flame thrower can kill
many snakes in one pass. The flame thrower also lights seats on fire. If a seat is on fire and a
snake runs into it, the snake will die because of the flames. This creates a strategy to stay behind
seats and continue to light them on fire while also being mindful of snakes that can attack from
behind. The graphics were all made in Adobe Illustrator to simulate classic style 8-bit games.
The animations are funny, graphic and are high in detail.


### Is the game original?

It is more than a shoot and avoid game because there are a few elements that make the game
more interesting. One element is that seats can be lit on fire so the agent can react with the
environment. Another element is that power ups can change the weapon being used. The agent
also cannot move through seats on the plane.


### Is the game fully functional?

The game includes a score counter that keeps track of the total score. The score is both time
based and based on the amount of anacondas that are killed. There is a health meter that keeps
track of Manuel’s health. Touching the snakes will decrease Manuel’s health. The player can
collect health power ups to gain more health if he has been damaged by the snakes. There is also
a meter that tracks the amount of ammo in the flame thrower. The shotgun has unlimited ammo
but the flame thrower can only be used for so long until it runs out of gas. The player needs to
collect the flame power up to get more fuel for the flame thrower.


### Is the game nontrivial?

Manuel can interact with his environment by only being able to move in the plane and not being
able to move through the seats. He can also light the seats on fire. All of the snakes have some
simple artificial intelligence to chase Manuel around the plane. They try to follow Manuel but
sometimes can get caught up in the seats.


### Is the game well documented?
I have included instructions on how to play the game in the game itself. The instructions are
under the instructions button on the home screen. The instructions are also in the zip file. I have
also included my updated design document and included this document of the grading criteria.
