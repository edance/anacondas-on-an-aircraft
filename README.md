## Overview

A man just witnessed a vicious murder of an FBI agent by a big time gangster. Manuel El
Jackson, an FBI agent, is in charge of making sure that he makes it to the trial. They are traveling
to the trial on the plane when the gangster releases a cage of venomous snakes that attack the
passengers. Manuel El Jackson has to keep everyone safe on the aircraft from these anacondas.
He is well equipped with weapons to fight the snakes. If he can keep the witness safe and make it
to the trial, Manuel El Jackson will help remove a serious criminal from the streets. The setting is
on a plane that is flying to the trial. The game is a shooter type game where your main priority is
to keep Manuel El Jackson alive so that he can continue to fight off all the snakes.

## Setup

At this point, I do not remember how to build this project. Hopefully I will figure it out.
